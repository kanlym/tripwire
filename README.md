### How do I get set up? ###

* Setup PHP PDO compatible database (MySQL) -- make sure event scheduler is on
* Import blank Tripwire database and EVE_API database (links above)
* EVE_API database needs 1 row inserted before use:
* `INSERT INTO eve_api.cacheTime (type, time) VALUES ('activity', now())`
* Create a `db.inc.php` file in root from `db.inc.example`
* Setup `tools/api_pull.php` under a 3 minute cron
* More to come...
